# Examples

This folder is a placeholder for additional examples. You can copy the code from
`app/main.py` or the notebook to try different configurations such as:

- Changing the number of hidden layers.
- Trying other activation functions like `tanh` or `logistic`.
- Enabling early stopping in `MLPRegressor` to reduce overfitting.
